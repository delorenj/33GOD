# TASK

Time to explain the full system as it works together. My plan is to have 2 levels across all components:

1. High Level Lay Person Marketing Explainer - Includes some technical talk, but brushes surface level - not enough to scare non-techies off.
2. Low Level In The Weeds Technical Implementation Specific - enough tech to make the career coder say "wow, this is awesome"

Then we'll have C4 docs that wrap each of the 5 domains and contains diagrams, data flow, and dependencies
