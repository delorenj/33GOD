# 33GOD 🤖🎭
> A powerful mixture-of-experts framework for building sophisticated AI agents

## Vision
33GOD is an ambitious open-source framework that aims to revolutionize how we build and deploy AI agents. At its core, 33GOD enables the creation of specialized agent domains, with its first practical implementation focusing on GitHub automation through intelligent PR management.

### Current Focus: GitHub Automation Domain
Our initial implementation demonstrates 33GOD's capabilities through a sophisticated PR splitting system, featuring:

- 🔍 **Split Analyzer Agent**: Analyzes PRs for semantic context and identifies logical split points
- 🛠 **Coder Agent**: Executes refactoring operations with zero-feature-change guarantee
- 👀 **Code Reviewer Agent**: Ensures compliance with PR rules and size constraints
- 🌲 **Branch Manager**: Maintains and orchestrates the PR branch structure

### Key Features
- 🎯 **Domain-Specific Expertise**: Specialized agents for distinct operational domains
- 🔄 **Rule-Based Execution**: Strict adherence to operational guidelines (e.g., 1000 SLOC limit per PR)
- 🧠 **Intelligent Orchestration**: Root agent coordinates specialized sub-agents
- 🛠 **Extensible Architecture**: Easy integration of new domains and specialized agents
- ✅ **Built-in Validation**: Comprehensive testing and verification tools

## Implementation Principles
- 💯 100% Feature Parity: Refactoring operations maintain complete functional equivalence
- 🔍 Progressive Consistency: Ensuring logical PR sequencing without future feature leakage
- 📝 Documentation-First: Thorough tracking of discoveries and improvements
- 🧪 Test-Driven: Comprehensive test coverage for validation

## Status
🚧 **Active Development** - Currently implementing the GitHub automation domain with focus on PR splitting capabilities.
