# 33GOD 🤖🎭

> A powerful mixture-of-experts framework for building sophisticated AI agents

## Vision

33GOD is an ambitious open-source framework that aims to revolutionize how we build and deploy AI agents. Built on top of Hugging Face's Smolagents, 33GOD introduces a novel mixture-of-experts architecture that allows for dynamic, context-aware agent behavior switching.

### Key Features (Coming Soon)

- 🎯 **Dynamic Expert Selection**: Intelligent routing of tasks to specialized expert models
- 🔄 **Seamless Context Switching**: Fluid transitions between different expert behaviors
- 🧠 **Meta-Learning Capabilities**: Agents that learn how to best utilize their expert ensemble
- 🛠 **Extensible Architecture**: Easy integration of custom experts and behaviors
- 📊 **Built-in Evaluation Framework**: Comprehensive metrics and analysis tools

## Development Approach

33GOD is being developed using the Common Project Framework (CPF), a formal opinionated developer workflow specifically designed for optimal compatibility with LLM-assisted development. This ensures:

- 🎯 Consistent project structure and conventions
- 📝 Clear documentation standards
- 🔄 Streamlined iteration cycles
- 🤝 Enhanced collaboration between human and AI developers
- 🧪 Robust testing practices

## Status

🚧 **Early Development** - We're actively working on the core architecture. Stay tuned for updates!
