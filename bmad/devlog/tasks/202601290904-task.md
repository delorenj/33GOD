**Me** *[00:01]*: I have a need, now that my service count has reached a lot, I have a need to figure out an optimal way to define each service and label. Define each service and label them as something like this is what I understand. So what is the best way for me to arrange my documents or to arrange my context or even like workflows that I can add to make it not so chaotic in how I maintain the high level architecture. I'm not so much concerned about the low level. I guess maybe they're two separate things, right? Maybe I want to have high level and low level like C4, but not so convoluted. I want, I want to have a corpus of docs that is as up to date as possible. 
**Me** *[01:18]*: So, so that I can point an LLM at it and it will know how they interconnect, which ones are dependencies on which ones, how I intend to do certain things. Because remember, this isn't finished. Each one of these services is very volatile, developing every one of these microservices at the same time. So it's hard for me to keep track of what changed and what didn't. I need a foolproof solid workflow. So here's what I was thinking. First I think the best thing to do would be to find the set of non overlapping domains for the services so I can have some groupings like you know, like I'm not going to need to pass in the context. The low, at least like you know, detailed low level context for every single servers at the same time. 
**Me** *[02:26]*: For instance, when I am developing the board, I find the need to pass in. You know, what's relevant here is the board, obviously the board room which is the front end independent rendering representation of it. And there's Blood bank which is the event service, Holy Fields, which is the contract that defines the events for Blood bank and maybe the services Hub because I have to register the board as a service. You see what I mean? So there's. But there's also a bunch of others I don't need to pass in, like Gelmore, which is the agentic coding abstraction layer and Holocene and you know, which is the. Which will be the main web based dashboard. So. It would be nice to find the non overlapping domains but if they need to overlap that's also fine. I guess it would just be. 
**Me** *[03:46]*: Just be logical in splitting them up. But then I could have one doc per domain, which is nice. Maybe there's four domains, maybe there's six. I don't know what they're going to be yet, but that's another level I can maintain and I'm thinking each service on its own can have a high level and technical level now keeping them all up to date. I already created a workflow I haven't tried it more than once yet but I would picture I would run this workflow every time I did a big change or maybe at least like once every sprint end just to make sure everything is up to parity and the workflow just gets everything in sync. 
**Me** *[04:37]*: It studies the entire high level of the service, of all the services and then focuses on the ones that may have changed and investigates the ones that it's not sure about. Surely there's a way to tap into git logs to get more precise and not waste tokens. But you see what I'm saying. That's what I want to know what the best way to do this and whatever it is I want to set out to like codify just the base of this because moving forward I think it's important.
