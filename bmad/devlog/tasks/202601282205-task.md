# TASK

I'd like have our Director of Engineering do some cross-component alignment on some very tightly coupled event-based components:

- Bloodbank (./bloodbank/trunk-main/)
- Holyfields (./holyfields/trunk-main/)
- Candybar (./candybar/trunk-main/)
- Candystore (./services/candystore)

## Instructions

1. Spin up 4 analysis agents
2. Assign each agent one of the four components. In parallel, ultrathink and do a deep inspection/audit of their component.

- Pay attention to its dependencies: what components rely on it. Which components does it rely on
- Try to infer what this component's responsibility is in the pipeline. What role does it play in the grand scheme.
- Show a few different views of the component as it fits in the pipline with a set of meticulously crafted mermaid diagrams

3. Then, with the knowledge you gathered, Examine the other 3 repositories (only the trunk-main) to specifically look for misunderstandings and misalignments. Any red flags? And improvements you would suggest given all you know about your assigned component. Write a comprehensive and exhaustive report on your findings
4. As a group, combine all four final reports and work towards a convergence
