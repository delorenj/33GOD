# Short Term Plan: Minimal Manager Agent for PR Splitting

## Objective
Implement a minimal viable manager agent using the smolagents framework. The agent will:
- Acknowledge receiving a PR splitting request.
- Pass the request to a repository.
- Respond with the branch name.
- Provide a high-level summarized change report listing key differences between the branch and the staging branch.

## Implementation Plan
1. **Manager Agent Implementation:**
   - Utilize the `CodeAgent` from smolagents.
   - The agent will handle the entire PR splitting smoke test process within a single implementation.
   - The agent will simulate internal delegation by invoking helper routines internally, without a separate subagent interface.

2. **Smoke Test Requirements:**
   - The agent must acknowledge that the PR splitting request has been received and processed.
   - It will output the branch name that was created.
   - It will print a summarized change report, highlighting the key differences introduced in the branch compared to the staging branch.
   - Logging and CLI output will provide immediate visual feedback ("warm and fuzzies") via a summarized report.

3. **Future Enhancements (Optional):**
   - If needed, extend the agent to delegate tasks to specialized subagents.
   - Implement advanced progress tracking with a dedicated user interface in CLI.

## Acceptance Criteria (Smoke Test)
- Upon receiving a PR splitting request, the manager agent should:
  - Confirm receipt.
  - Output the branch name.
  - Present a summarized change report (e.g., "Feature X added; Bugfix Y applied").
