# Jelmore: Session Intelligence for Claude Code

## What It Does

Jelmore is a session manager specifically designed for Claude Code interactions. It tracks your conversations with AI assistants, maintains context across sessions, and enables sophisticated workflows that span multiple interactions—all while preserving the natural conversational interface.

## Why It Matters

Working with AI coding assistants typically means each conversation is isolated. You ask Claude to build a feature, it does. Next session, you want to modify that feature, but Claude has no memory of the previous work unless you provide full context again.

This leads to repetitive context-setting, lost insights from previous sessions, and an inability to build complex systems across multiple conversations. It's like working with a brilliant but amnesiac assistant who forgets everything between meetings.

Jelmore solves this by providing persistent memory and intelligent session management for Claude Code.

## Real-World Benefits

**For Long-Running Projects**: Build complex features across multiple sessions. Claude remembers the architecture decisions from yesterday, the code patterns from last week, and the constraints established at project start.

**For Context Efficiency**: Stop repeating yourself. Jelmore maintains context, so you can say "refactor the authentication module we built last Tuesday" without re-explaining the entire system.

**For Learning and Improvement**: Jelmore tracks what works and what doesn't across sessions. Claude can reference previous approaches, avoid repeating mistakes, and build on successful patterns from past work.

**For Session Workflows**: Define multi-step workflows that span sessions. Start with research in session one, architecture in session two, implementation in session three—each building naturally on previous work.

## The Memory Architecture

Jelmore doesn't just save transcripts—it extracts and indexes meaningful information: architectural decisions, code patterns, established conventions, unresolved issues, and project context. This structured memory enables intelligent recall.

## The Integration Story

Jelmore works seamlessly with Claude Code, enhancing it with persistence without changing the conversational interface. You still talk to Claude naturally; Jelmore works behind the scenes to ensure continuity and context.

## The Bottom Line

Jelmore transforms ephemeral AI conversations into persistent development partnerships. It's the difference between starting from scratch every time and having an AI assistant that truly knows your project's history. Perfect for developers building complex systems with AI assistance who need continuity, context preservation, and the ability to build sophisticated solutions across multiple sessions.
